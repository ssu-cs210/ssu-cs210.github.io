Conventions
***********



This lab manual uses several conventions to make explanations and instructions easier to understand.


Normal text will be set with the same type as in this sentence.
Names of utilities or commands and filenames are set in ``monospaced`` typeface. Files are also set in monostpace, and will typically look like this: :file:`/path/to/the/file`.
Sometimes there is no need to express the full path of the file.  In these cases the path portion (the :file:`/path/to/the/` part in the example) will be ommitted in the file reference.

In many exercises you will be presented with example output that show commands that need to be executed and a sample otput of its result.
These are set in monospaced fonts and are enclosed in a box with a light gray background:

.. parsed-literal::

    me\@tuxbox:~$ :command:`date`
    Sat Jan 21 07:18:52 UTC 2017
    me\@tuxbox:~$ :command:`uname`
    Linux
    me\@tuxbox:~$ :command:`exit`
    logout
    Connection to 172.17.0.2 closed.

Commands or text that you need to enter, either within a paragraph or inside an example output box, are shown in :command:`bold` typeface.
In the previous example, you are instructed to type the commands ``date``, ``uname`` and ``exit``. 
Note that in the example output you are supposed to press the :kbd:`ENTER` key after each command.
Example output will always omit the :kbd:`ENTER`.

When you are required to press certain non-printable keystrokes, these will be set in monospace and enclosed in a frame. Examples of these are the :kbd:`ENTER`, :kbd:`ESC`, :kbd:`ALT`, :kbd:`SHIFT` and :kbd:`CTRL` keys.
When multiple keys need to be pressed at the same time, this is denoted by the "+" symbol.
As an example, :kbd:`CTRL+v` means to press the keys :kbd:`CTRL` and :kbd:`v` at the same time. 


Sometimes a screen capture will be handy to explain a topic.  These will be shown in a dark background, such as this:

.. image:: screen.png


Items that require special attention are highlited as notes:

.. note:: Note Example

    This is an example of a note.

In this course, you will be asked to perform some tasks or answer some questions.  These will be presented as a *Worksheet* note:

.. admonition:: Worksheet
    :class: worksheet

    * What happens if you run the command :command:`rm -r \\`? 
    * How many bits are in a byte? 
    * Who many processes are running?
